                  <h2>Introduction </h2>
                  <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                     language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                     objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                     language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                     for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                        Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                        elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                        navigation.
                     </li>
                     <br>
                     <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                        on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                        database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or
                        perform file manipulations on a server.
                     </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
                  <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                     language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                     follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the
                     reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
                     system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                     JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The
                     prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual
                     objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can
                     be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                     classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                     protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types
                     are not explicitly typed.
